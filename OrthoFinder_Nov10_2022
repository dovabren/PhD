#results: 
OrthoFinder assigned 20327 genes (80.8% of total) to 7610 orthogroups. Fifty percent of all genes were in orthogroups with 2 or more genes (G50 was 2) and were contained in the largest 3738 orthogroups (O50 was 3738). There were 6805 orthogroups with all species present and 5260 of these consisted entirely of single-copy genes
